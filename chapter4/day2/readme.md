>1.What does .link() do?


>2.In your own words (no code), explain how we can use resource interfaces to only expose certain things to the /public/ path.


>3.Deploy a contract that contains a resource that implements a resource interface. Then, do the following:
> - In a transaction, save the resource to storage and link it to the public with the restrictive interface.
> - Run a script that tries to access a non-exposed field in the resource interface, and see the error pop up.
> - Run the script and access something you CAN read from. Return it from the script.
