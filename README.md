## Chapter 1 Day 1 Quests.

1)Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. 

Blockchain is a growing list of recrods, called blocks, that are securely linked together using cryptograpthy. 

2)Explain what a Smart Contract is. 

Smart contract is a computer program, written "on" blockhain that performs some operations based on some logic.
for example - Vending machine is like smart contract = you put coin inside and get a drink =)

3)Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.

Transaction is a "paid" function call. Transaction CHANGES data on the Blockchain.
Script is like VIEW ONLY operation - you don't have to pay money - you just view data stored on blockchain.

## Chapter 1 Day 2 Quests.

1)What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

-Safety and Security.
-Clarity.
-Approachability.
-Developer Expirience.
-Resource Oriented Programming.

2)In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

In any "game" it is good to have rules. If you want a good game, you need to have good rules. And if you want to be a good player you have to stick some principles. So this "pillars" help everyone focus on user and develper expirience - so this is a good step towards so-called "MASS ADOPTION" of crypto. (so the "entrance level" from both sides - devs and users improves)
